## Running the puzzles
The two little programs here are solutions to the puzzles described in [CHALLANGE.md](./CHALLANGE.md).

## Running the puzzles

Make sure to install the `ava` test runner with `yarn` or `nmp`.
```
yarn install
```

Then run the tests for each puzzle:
```
yarn test:puzzle-1
```
and
```
yarn test:puzzle-2
```
Your can also execute all tests at once by running:
```
yarn test
```
